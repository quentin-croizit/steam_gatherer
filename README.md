# steam_gatherer

A small program that gathers steam games' reviews using the steam api and formats that to json and csv

To use the program, just launch the `app.bat` file and follow what it offers you to do.

Make sure to have dotnet, the csvhelper library (<https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper>) and python installed on your machine.
